Portfolio for Art

Work in Progress.

Mostly working with vanilla JS to render content on the front end responsively based on data retrieved from a DB using Node.js and MongoDB.

Through /Compose I can easily add and remove items to Resume list and change Bio text. 
Through /addPortfolio I can intuitively upload images (multiple images at once) and text, as well as order them.

I am currently working on building a drag and drop functionality to determine the order of how images are shown in each individual group, as well as the order of the groups.

Further work will include: 
-to add authentication to the /Compose and /addPortfolio pages. 
-improving styling on how images are loaded and how they are shown. 
-creating a nicer slideview functionality to view images. 
-and more...
